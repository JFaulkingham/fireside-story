    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Everyone had left town long ago...</p>
    <p>Due to an outbreak of weasels who had a taste for shoes...</p>
    <p>There was only one man who knew the solution to the outbreak...</p>
    <p> Yet unfortunately, his shoes were eaten by the weasels. He could not walk, for without his yeezys, the man could not leave his home...</p>
    <p>And without leaving his house, he could not drop the greatest album of all time.</p>
